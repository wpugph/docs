Readme First 1.0.1
==================

This repository is for the publicly available documents of WordPress User Groups Philippines (WPUGPH). Published and maintained by the organizing team.


Please use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
------------------------------------

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes (major revisions),
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner (add new sections), and 
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes(fixing typos and other corrections).

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
