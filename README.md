This repository is for the publicly available documents of WordPress User Groups Philippines (WPUGPH). Published and maintained by the organizing team.

Usage of this Repository
------------------------

- The purpose of this repository is to provide an inventory of WPUGPH documents in one location.
- For official documents, sources must be cited and all revisions from source must be reflected here. 
- Minor formatting changes to documents are allowed solely for the reason of improving presentation and readability.
- Any change to documents will be reviewed by the organizing team via pull requests. Only [atomic commits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit) will be approved.
- Direct link to documents in this repository can be provided to anyone who requests it.

Please use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0
------------------------------------

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes (major revisions),
2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner (add new sections), and 
3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes(fixing typos and other corrections).

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
