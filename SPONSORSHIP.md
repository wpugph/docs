Sponsorship Guidelines 1.0.0
============================

WordCamp and WordPress Meetup sponsorship rules (2017 onwards)
--------------------------------------------------------------

This is an all-volunteer, community event and our relationship with sponsors is one of partnership and mutual interest/respect. We will work with you to find creative ways to match your needs with ours to benefit both our attendees and your brand.

**If your brand represents a software product, it must be GPL friendly.**

Sponsors may apply but will not be guaranteed speaking spots. Remember, all presentations must be related to WordPress to be included in WordCamp or WordPress meetups.

Funds must be received before sponsorship will be announced to the public.

**1. Sponsor may provide:**

- The sponsor’s name and logo
- Slogans that are an established part of the sponsor’s image
- The sponsor’s brands and trade names
- Sponsor contact information (such as telephone numbers, email addresses, and URLs)
- Factual (value-neutral) displays of actual products
- Displays or handout materials (such as brochures) with factual, non-comparative descriptions or listings of products or services
- Price information, or other indications of savings or value, if factual and provable
- Inducements to purchase or use the Sponsor’s products or services, for example by providing coupons or discount purchase codes (subject to approval)
- Calls to action, such as “visit this site for details”, “call now for a special offer”, “join our league of savings”, etc.

**2. Sponsors may not provide:**

- Promotional or marketing material containing superlative messages or unprovable claims about the Sponsor, its products or services, such as “the first name in WordPress hosting”, “the easiest way to launch your site”, or “the best e-commerce plugin”
Claims that WordPress, WordPress Foundation, meetup organizers, WordCamps, or WordCamp organizers endorse or favor a Sponsor or its products or services (such as “certified WordPress training” or “WordCamp’s favorite plugin”)

**3. Sponsors agree** that the WordPress Foundation, any subsidiary or related entity of the Foundation, and WP Meetup/WordCamp organizers have the right to request and review sponsor materials in advance of an event, to require changes to any materials in advance, and to require that any materials that do not meet the above expectations be taken down or that any practices that do not meet the above expectations be discontinued during a WordCamp or WP Meetup event. 

The above restrictions also apply to material placed on any self-serve swag tables reserved for sponsor use.

**4. All sponsors are expected** to support the WordPress project and its principles, including:

- No discrimination on the basis of economic or social status, race, color, ethnic origin, national origin, creed, religion, political belief, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, age, or disability.
- No incitement to violence or promotion of hate
- No spammers
- No jerks
- Respect the WordPress trademark.
- Embrace the WordPress license; If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business officially associated with WordCamp/WP Meetup should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides: 100% GPL or compatible, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.
- Don’t promote companies or people that violate the trademark or distribute WordPress derivative works which aren’t 100% GPL compatible.

**5. Sponsorship is in no way connected to the opportunity to speak** at an official WordPress event and does not alter the WordPress or WordCamp trademark usage policy found at http://wordpressfoundation.org/. The WordPress Foundation and any subsidiary or related entity of the Foundation reserve the right to modify the above requirements and expectations at any time by providing written notice to the sponsor.
